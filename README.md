# my art and design projects 
<br>
★ drawings are <b>made with </b> ibis paint x (free version) running on my outdated oppo phone from 2019. i use my fingers + custom ibispaint brushes since i do not have a tablet. colorhunt for palettes
<br><br>
★ 3d designs are <b>made with</b> a combination of blender (desktop windows 10), vectary (browser based/most used), womp (browser based), nomad sculpt (free version least used on mobile with my fingers) and spline (browser + free). <br>
i use pacdora to create mockups to visualize stuff for my own small business but did not log the hours spent working on my biz for arcade
