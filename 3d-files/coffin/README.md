# coffin box
i made a two piece coffin shaped box with a cross on top (bc im soooo wannabe goth but cant pull it off) for small jewelry items like rings from evry jewels but the parts have weird dimensions (bc i made them separately) and dont seem to fit properly (because i did the math wrong) :// this is NOT a coffin though this is just a coffin shaped box
